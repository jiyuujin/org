While acquiring basic coding through work as an application engineer, I also worked on improving the UX of the management screen (PHP) that runs behind it. I was fascinated by the part that went through the process of improving the Web, and gradually stepped into the area of front-end engineers, such as Node.js and other front-ends, CSS design, and the use of frameworks.",
