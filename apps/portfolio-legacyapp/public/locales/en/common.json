  "work_experience": "My career started as an iOS native app engineer. Through my work as an app engineer, I gained fundamental coding skills while also working on improving the UX of the management website (PHP) that ran behind the scenes. I found the process of improving the web side of things particularly appealing, which led me to gradually explore the front-end engineering field, including technologies like Node.js, CSS design, and JavaScript frameworks.\nCurrently, I focus on optimizing the design of entire applications, including cloud services (Azure / AWS), while working daily to enhance their quality and proactively add new features. Additionally, as a member of the LINE Developers Community's API Expert group, I actively promote LINE's front-end framework and Messaging API. For the REV UP 2022 conference organized by LINE Developers, I was responsible for creating the official website.\nIn the future, I plan to continue sharing knowledge and contributing to communities not only through my personal blog but also through platforms like Zenn.",

    "tech_blog_description": "This is a personal blog that was created and launched in October 2018 using Nuxt (v1.0.0-rc.11) to share my knowledge. The name was chosen based on my love for cats, which is a characteristic of mine, and it is operated with the goal of fostering a product-oriented mindset as a web developer. At the time, one of the popular Headless CMS platforms, Contentful, was gaining attention, and there was a growing need to have a personal product outside of work to seek new challenges and stimulation. During the course of its operation, I rewrote the blog in TypeScript, adopted the Decorator API, and eventually switched to the Composition API to support Nuxt 3. Currently, I have transitioned to Lume, a static site generator running on Deno, which offers easy configuration and flexibility for customization.",

Similarly, at Vue Fes Japan, I have been a core staff member for three consecutive years since 2022, supporting the conference staff operations. My participation in both events was driven by the desire to challenge myself with Vue.js-related technologies beyond my main job and to engage in communication with various experts. Among these experiences, I have been responsible for leading the launch of the name card for Vue Fes Japan 2023-24, including the selection of technologies like Supabase, and actively leading the team.",
