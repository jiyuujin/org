While acquiring basic coding skills through my work as an application developer, I also worked on improving the UX of the administration website (PHP) that runs behind the applications. I was attracted to this part of the web improvement process, and gradually entered the realm of front-end engineering, including Node.js, CSS design, and the use of JavaScript frameworks. And now, while considering the optimal solution for the overall design of applications including the Cloud (Azure/AWS), I am practicing daily to improve their quality and add aggressive features.",

The name comes from my love of cats, which is a characteristic of myself, and as a Web Developer, I am operating this blog with the goal of having a product mindset. At the time, Contentful, one of the headless CMS, was running, and I was unable to find a lasting product for my work, so I had an urgent need to have a personal product that would not be affected by any external influences. I started to work with Nuxt (`v1.0.0-rc.11` at that time) as a base. After rewriting to TypeScript and adopting the Decorator API, we switched to the Composition API in order to support Nuxt 3. Currently, we are operating in an unprecedented way, changing the technology stack from Nuxt to Deno.",
